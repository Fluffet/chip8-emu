Chip8 emulator in Python 3.7

This is a Chip8 emulator for Python 3.7. I wrote it to learn a little bit about curses and also try out dataclasses for Python 3.7; they reminded me of structs. I have also always wanted to try writing an emulator. :)

TODO:
  * Input is almost done. I think.
  * Curses error handling
